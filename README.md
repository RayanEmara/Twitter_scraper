Script for scraping the twitter front end API using a nitter instance ( nitter.net in this case).

## Road map

- [ ] Rewriting in java/rust
- [ ] Sanitizing sensitive info
- [ ] Adding support for tweet body
- [ ] Adding async support
- [ ] Adding some sort of clustering/distributed capability
- [ ] Rewriting as a serious library
